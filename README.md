1. Run the container image infracloudio/csvserver:latest in background and check if it's running
    the image was not running as expected so checked the logs.
      ex: docker logs 4e784b57a309949c64de4daa39fd603c1db0e8aea4ea291ea8493d65f1b425c5
      error : 2023/12/27 15:03:29 error while reading the file "/csvserver/inputdata": open /csvserver/inputdata: no such file or directory
2. If it's failing then try to find the reason, once you find the reason, move to the next step

3. Write a bash script gencsv.sh to generate a file named inputFile
     created the script gencsv.sh 

4. Run the container again in the background with file generated in (3) available inside the container (remember the reason you found in (2)).
     run the container with refrece of file generated by the script.
       docker run -d -v "$(pwd)/inputFile:/csvserver/inputdata" infracloudio/csvserver:latest

5.Get shell access to the container and find the port on which the application is listening. Once done, stop / delete the running container.
     checked for the port using below cmd
       docker exec -it fbb7946dd8b4 /bin/bash
     run cmd to check the port 
       netstat -tulpn 
     port was 9300
     removed running container
       docker stop fbb7946dd8b4
       docker rm fbb7946dd8b4
5. Same as (4), run the container and make sure,The application is accessible on the host at http://localhost:9393 Set the environment variable CSVSERVER_BORDER to have value Orange.

   set the envirnoment variable
      export CSVSERVER_BORDER=Orange
   
   run docker container
      docker run -d -v "$(pwd)/inputFile:/csvserver/inputdata" infracloudio/csvserver:latest
